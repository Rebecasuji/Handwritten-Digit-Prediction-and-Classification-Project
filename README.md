Handwritten Digit Prediction and Classification Project
Overview
This project focuses on building a machine learning model to predict and classify handwritten digits. The dataset used is the famous MNIST dataset, which consists of 70,000 images of handwritten digits (0-9). The project involves data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and deployment.

Features
Data Preprocessing: Includes normalization and reshaping of images.
Model Training: Training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify digits.
Model Evaluation: Performance evaluation using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Deployment: Serving the model using a web application for real-time predictions.
Dataset
The MNIST dataset is a collection of 70,000 grayscale images of handwritten digits. Each image is 28x28 pixels.
